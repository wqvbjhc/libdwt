UTIA ASVP platform 
==================

For cross-compilation for UTIA ASVP platform (formerly EdkDSP platform)
unpack files from asvpsdk-api-1.0.zip archive into ./api directory. This
archive can be downloaded from:

http://sp.utia.cz/index.php?ids=projects/smecy&id=downloads

Now, you will need properly configured PicoBlaze and PetaLinux compiler for
library compilation. You can test it on example application in directory
./examples/simple with command:

make ARCH=microblaze

PC platform
===========
Compile the example application like above but with command:

make ARCH=x86_64

For example, a simple application showing libdwt API usage can be compiled
and started with:

make -C examples/simple run

== Dependencies ==
* glibc/uClibc
* ASVP/EdkDSP SDK (optional on ASVP)
* Make
* GCC
** OpenMP support (optional)
* PicoBlaze C Compiler Toolchain V2 (optional on ASVP)
