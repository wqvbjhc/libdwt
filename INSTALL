UTIA ASVP platform 
==================

For cross-compilation for UTIA ASVP platform (formerly EdkDSP platform)
unpack files from asvpsdk-api-1.0.zip archive into ./api directory. This
archive can be downloaded from:

http://sp.utia.cz/index.php?ids=projects/smecy&id=downloads

Now, you will need properly configured PicoBlaze and PetaLinux compiler for
library compilation. You can test it on example application in directory
./examples/simple with command:

make ARCH=microblaze
